A [remark](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark) plugin built on remark-directive, providing predefined directives for image captions, video embedding, styled GitHub links, badges, and more.

## Usage

[See how to use it](https://astro-antfustyle-theme.vercel.app/blog/markdown-mdx-extended-features/#image-figure), where the styles need to be custom written and added.

The basic functionality has been implemented, but it's still a work in progress.
